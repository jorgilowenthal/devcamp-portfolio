                According to all known laws
                of aviation,
                there is no way a bee
                should be able to fly.
                Its wings are too small to get
                its fat little body off the ground.
            </p>
            <p>
                The bee, of course, flies anyway
                because bees don't care
                what humans think is impossible.
